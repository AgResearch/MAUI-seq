This file MC_parameters.py is required by MAUIcount.py and should be in the same folder 
as the script (or another path that will be found).
It specifies gene-specific parameters and the sequence files to be analysed and needs to
be edited appropriately for your project.

#These values will replace the defaults - comment them out to use the defaults

#If set to True, output the total number of reads contributing to the UMI primary and secondary counts
